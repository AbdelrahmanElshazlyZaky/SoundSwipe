# SoundSwipe
SoundSwipe is a fun project that helps children learn music by using hand movements. When kids make specific gestures, the system plays musical notes or scales. This lets them explore music in an interactive way, making learning both enjoyable and educational. The goal is to teach kids about melody and rhythm through play and movement
